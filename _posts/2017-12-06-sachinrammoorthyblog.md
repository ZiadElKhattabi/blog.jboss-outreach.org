It’s been more than an hour and I haven’t moved an inch. My brother has made several attempts to try to get me to look at him, but I don’t budge. This is time for concentration.

This is what happens to me when I am engrossed in any task. And Google Code In has done just that. It has only been about 2 days since it started, but ever since then, every spare moment I have had the privilege of experiencing is spent browsing the GCI Home page for new tasks or hoping for approval on my current tasks.

I find programming to be a fascinating subject, and want to pursue a career in this field. I am absolutely certain that Google Code In and JBoss, the organisation that the majority of my tasks belong to, will help me make this dream a reality.
